Hello there! Welcome to my blog. I can't believe I'm doing this, but here we are. If you think this is dumb and I didn't need a blog, same. Someone asked my to write up a blog post about a personal project I did, so here we are. Honestly this was a lot of work and I'd much rather be sleeping, but sleeping never got me anywhere so screw that. Don't expect a serious tone from me as I'm like one step above "I'm here so I don't get fined." I know you're going to ask question like "Isn't this a personal blog?" and "It's not like you're being forced to write it right?" and while those are both correct, it really undercuts the constant complaining motif I was going for.

Don't expect a lot of updates, I've never been able to do that consistently. I figure if I set your expectations low enough now, I will have less disappointment later. So, to recap:

1. Don't expect a lot of posts
2. Don't expect a serious tone all the time.
3. Don't be a dick.

Thanks for reading, I guess. Honestly I'm surprised you made it this far. I guess I'm not the only one with nothing better to do.
