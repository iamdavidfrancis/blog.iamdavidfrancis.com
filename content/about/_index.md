So I guess this is where I talk about myself? Weird. I'm a Software Engineer and sometimes people seem interested in what I say. If you are interested, this blog is for you I guess. If not, I feel ya. 

Don't expect a lot of content here, but who knows what will happen. Maybe I'll get bored again and actually post something here again.  Anyway, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hzrDeceEKc) Wonderwall.

Full Disclosure: I'm a Software Engineer at Microsoft. While I tend to prefer using Azure tooling over other cloud providers, this is due to my familiarity with it. Any opinions shared on this site are mine and do not reflect my employer's views in any way.
